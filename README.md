# MathWro QOL

A personal World of Warcraft addon for quality-of-life tweaks. Built for Midnight patch 12.1.0 (`120100`).

## Compatibility

The addon targets Retail patch 12.1.0. `Buff Health Color` uses Blizzard's secure Aura Container system, so restricted combat aura presence stays engine-managed instead of being read by addon Lua. EllesmereUI Raid Frames provides its own Aura Container-based buff indicators and MathWroQOL does not duplicate that runtime.

Provider integrations are optional and remain inactive when their provider is unavailable. CooldownManagerCentered viewer skinning requires both CooldownManagerCentered and Masque to be loaded.

## Features

### General

**Game Menu Scale**
Scale the Escape menu up or down. Range: 0.5× – 2.0×. Persists across sessions.

**Game Menu Dragging**
Make the Escape menu freely draggable. Position is saved and restored on each login. Includes a Reset Position button to snap it back to centre.

**CDM Button**
Adds a "CDM" button to the Escape menu that directly opens the Cooldown Manager window (`CooldownViewerSettings`). It discovers the lowest visible custom menu button between Shop/Options and AddOns, hides its stale position while other integrations arrange themselves, then inserts itself without hardcoded addon-button names or unnecessary menu spacing. The button uses ElvUI styling when only ElvUI is active, an exact guarded EllesmereUI popup-menu skin when only EllesmereUI is active, and native Blizzard styling when both or neither suite is active. Also registers `/wa` and `/cm` chat commands as shortcuts. All three (button, `/wa`, `/cm`) can be toggled independently in the options panel.

**Auction House Filters**
Automatically pre-enables selected filters each time you open the Auction House. Two independent toggles in the options panel: "Current expansion only" and "Usable only". Filters are re-applied on every AH open so any in-session manual changes are reset.

### Combat Logging

**Automatic Combat Logging**
Automatically starts combat logging only while you are in a selected instance type: dungeons, Mythic+ dungeons, raids, scenarios, PvP, and arenas each have independent toggles. When you transition to an unselected type or leave instances, the addon stops only logging it started. Optional max-level-only gate also stops addon-started logging while levelling. Respects manual stop — if you disable logging mid-instance, the addon will not re-enable it until you leave all instances.

### CVars and Settings

**Camera Distance** *(disabled by default)*
Checks `cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor` each login and restores the Retail maximum of 2.6 when enabled.

**Spell Queue Window** *(disabled by default)*
Never changes your existing queue window until you explicitly enable it. First activation captures your current value unchanged; use the 0–400ms slider only when you want to enforce a different value on later logins. The options panel shows the client-reported WoW default alongside the selected value.

### Combat Tracker

**Racials, Trinkets & Consumables**
Displays icon bars for racial abilities, equipped trinkets, and consumable items (combat potions, healing potions, mana potions, healthstones). Each section tracks cooldowns with swipe animations and optional countdown text. Consumables show stack counts from your inventory. Individual racial abilities can be hidden via the options panel; the Trinkets panel accepts a comma-separated list of item IDs to exclude lore-only or otherwise unwanted on-use trinkets. When both a regular and fleeting version of a consumable are in your bags, only the fleeting version is shown.

**Layout & Positioning**
Each section can be positioned independently via Edit Mode (LibEditMode integration) or merged into another section's bar. Layout options include horizontal row, vertical column, and grid with configurable icons-per-row. Anchor direction controls growth direction.

**Customisation**
Per-section icon width and height sliders. Stack counter and cooldown countdown text with independent font and size controls. Custom item tracking by item ID. Reorderable item display with drag-style up/down arrows showing Midnight-style rank quality icons. Optional Masque skinning integration.

### External Tracker *(disabled by default)*

Track buffs applied to you: Pain Suppression, Guardian Spirit, Ironbark, Life Cocoon, Blessing of Sacrifice, Blessing of Protection, Blessing of Spellwarding, Blessing of Freedom, Time Dilation, Power Infusion, and Innervate.

Open **External Tracker** in `/mqol`, enable the module, then select and enable individual spells. Each spell independently supports **Icon with duration**, **Sound only**, or **Icon and sound**. Sound choices come from LibSharedMedia provided by your enabled addons, with a Preview Sound button. The dropdown scrolls through long lists and picks up newly registered sounds whenever it opens. Select a sound explicitly; **None** is silent. Missing libraries or sound packs do not affect icons and never substitute another sound.

Blizzard's secure Aura Slots manage icon visibility and remaining duration; native aura sound registrations play on buff application through the Master channel. Selected buffs include self-casts because the sound API cannot filter by caster. Settings are locked during combat.

**Edit Mode appearance:** select External Tracker in Blizzard Edit Mode to move the row and adjust **Icon size** (20–80px), **Icon zoom** (0–30% cropped from each edge), and **Glow type** (None, Classic, Modern Proc, or Assisted Combat). These settings apply to all tracked icons. A Power Infusion example previews changes even when no spells are enabled; it disappears on exit and never triggers a sound. Glow defaults to None; the default 8% zoom preserves the previous icon crop. Reset Position remains in the submenu.

### Bloodlust Tracker *(disabled by default)*

In `/mqol` → **External Tracker**, enable **Bloodlust Tracker** for a separate duration icon. It works whether the external tracker is enabled or disabled. Bloodlust, Heroism, Time Warp, Fury of the Aspects, Primal Rage (including its alternate aura), legacy hunter equivalents, and drums through Void-touched Drums are recognized automatically. The icon shows the active buff and its remaining duration, not the Exhaustion/Sated lockout.

Select **Bloodlust Tracker** in Blizzard Edit Mode to move its Bloodlust preview and adjust its own size, zoom, and glow. Position and appearance are independent of the external tracker; its Reset Position button is in the same submenu. Bloodlust tracking is icon-only and does not change external spell sounds.

### Edit Mode

**Edit Mode Nudge**
Adds arrow buttons and a coordinate readout when a Blizzard Edit Mode or LibEditMode frame is selected. Nudge frames by 1px per click, or 10px with Shift held. Coordinates display the frame's position relative to screen centre.

### UI Integrations

Integrations are split into **ElvUI** and **EllesmereUI** submenus. Each provider's controls are disabled when that provider (or its required module) is not loaded.

**Unlock Mode Nudge — EllesmereUI** *(requires EllesmereUI Unlock Mode; disabled by default)*
Adds the same arrow controls to EllesmereUI Unlock Mode movers and uses EUI's native pixel-grid coordinate readout and movement units.

**Vehicle Bar Visibility** *(requires ElvUI or EllesmereUI Action Bars)*
Keep selected action bars (1–10) visible during vehicle combat and override bar states (e.g. shapeshift-style encounters). Handles each provider's secure visibility drivers and prevents its mouseover fade from hiding selected bars while usable vehicle abilities are active. Normal visibility and fade behaviour are restored on exit. By default only bar 1 is enabled.

**Buff Health Color — ElvUI** *(requires ElvUI)*
Recolor selected ElvUI unit frame health bars while units have configured player-cast buffs. The tint is rendered by secure 12.1 Aura Slots, preserving the feature in combat without exposing restricted aura state to addon Lua. Includes per-buff settings for Atonement, Lifebloom, Prayer of Mending, Riptide, Beacon of the Savior, Renewing Mist, plus custom spell IDs that add more buff profiles alongside the built-ins. Each buff can be enabled, colored, assigned to player, target, party, or ElvUI raid frame sizes, and restricted to relevant player specializations independently.

**Buff Health Color — EllesmereUI**
EllesmereUI Raid Frames already provides this functionality natively. In its Buff Manager, create an indicator and select **Health Bar Color** to configure spell assignment, ownership, color, and opacity. MathWroQOL deliberately does not install a second competing recolor runtime.

### CDM Plugins *(requires CooldownManagerCentered and Masque)*

**Centered Cooldown Manager Masque Skinning**
Registers CooldownManagerCentered's icon viewers with Masque so their icons can use the same skins as the rest of the UI. The Essential, Utility, and Buff Icons viewers can be enabled independently in the options panel. When enabled, three groups appear in Masque under MathWroQOL: CMC Essential, CMC Utility, and CMC Buff Icons.

### Debug

**Buff Health Color Diagnostics**
Adds a Debug section to the options panel with quick buttons for Target, Party 1, Raid 1, and Player. Each button prints Buff Health Color diagnostic details to chat, including Aura Container availability, active profiles, configured Aura Slot counts, specialization, and matching ElvUI unit frames. Aura presence is intentionally reported as engine-managed. The same diagnostic is available with `/mqolbuffdebug <unit>`.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
